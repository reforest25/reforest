            <h1>Project Background</h1>
            <p>I chose to make a forest simulator for Codeavour 6.0 as global temperatures are rising, and that will cause problems for the near future. Deforestation is one of the main reasons behind rising global temperature. This problem needs to be resolved quickly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>The solution to solve rising global temperatures is to fight against it. To do so, more trees need to be planted. But not everyone knows and wants to do so. Which is why re:forest is created, a project that helps to raise awareness about this issue and could also be used to calculate useful outcomes for a forest or an individual tree.</p>

            <h3>Project Initiation</h3>
            <p>There were many problems contributing to rising global temperatures. Deforestation stood out as a key issue. I realized that reforestation is one of the easiest ways to fight against this. However, not everyone understands its importance. Which is why re:forest was created, a program to raise awareness of the impact trees can have in solving this problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="development-card">
            <h1>2</h1>
            <h3>Project Planning</h3>
            <p>Thinking outside of the box was crucial to create this project. Since the program needed to be user-friendly, the UI needed to be clean and simple, the features must be realistic but not too complex. Performance was also a crucial part of this program. These are the key ideas that shaped re:forest as a program. A way to plant trees is needed, which is why the program has tiles. Tree growth is another thing, one of the most important parts of this program, having many factors, and making those factors customizable was the plan.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="development-card">
            <h1>3</h1>
            <h3>Project Execution</h3>
            <p>With just around 20 days until the competition deadline, I began building the tile system, followed by data storage for each tile. I then developed the tree planting system, designed the UI, and created sprites. I implemented growth factors, including rain, seasons, soil quality, and moisture. A key feature was displaying simulation data like days, seasons, carbon reduction, and oxygen production. After completing the settings and adding a user guide, the program was ready.</p>

            <h1>4</h1>
            <h3>Project Monitoring and Controlling</h3>
            <p>Once the project was complete, I asked for feedback from a few users. Based on their input, I refined the program and made necessary adjustments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="development-card">
            <h1>5</h1>
            <h3>Project Closure</h3>
            <p>Before submitting, I created a banner and a video showcasing the project. With some extra time, I made final improvements to the program and submitted it to Codeavour.</p>
